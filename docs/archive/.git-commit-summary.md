## Changes Made

### Project Structure
- Created complete monorepo structure for Continuum
- Set up frontend/ directory with Vue.js 3 + TypeScript
- Set up backend/ directory with Python Flask
- Created infrastructure/ directory for Terraform and Kubernetes configs
- Created docs/, scripts/, tests/ directories

### Frontend Setup (Vue.js 3)
- Initialized Vue 3 project with TypeScript
- Configured Pinia for state management
- Set up Vue Router for navigation
- Included Vitest for testing
- Configured ESLint and Prettier
- Created .env.local with API configuration
- Updated package.json with Continuum branding

### Backend Setup (Python/Flask)
- Created Flask API with basic health check endpoint
- Added /api/categories endpoint with 4 category definitions
- Created requirements.txt with Flask, CORS, testing, and code quality tools
- Created .env.example with configuration template
- Set up basic CORS configuration for frontend communication

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- Created docker-compose.yml for local development
- Created comprehensive .gitignore for Node, Python, Docker, Terraform

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with Continuum branding and quick start
- Created docs/ARCHITECTURE.md with system overview
- Created docs/QUICK_START.md with development commands
- Updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with completed tasks and notes

### Technical Decisions
1. **Vue.js 3** instead of React (user preference)
2. **Flask** for backend (simple, can migrate to FastAPI later)
3. **Pinia** for state management (official Vue recommendation)
4. **Vite** as build tool (included in Vue scaffolding)
5. **TypeScript** for type safety in frontend

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- .gitignore
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- backend/app.py
- backend/requirements.txt
- backend/.env.example
- backend/README.md
- docker-compose.yml
- scripts/setup.sh
- docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
- docs/QUICK_START.md
- frontend/.env.local
- frontend/ (entire Vue.js project)

### Modified Files
- README.md (complete rewrite with Continuum branding)
- frontend/package.json (updated name and version)

## Next Steps

### Phase 1 - Core Kanban UI (Next)
